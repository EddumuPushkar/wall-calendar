Interactive Calendar Component

Overview

This project is a responsive, interactive calendar component built using React.js, inspired by a physical wall calendar design.  
The goal was to translate a static visual concept into a functional, user-friendly UI while maintaining strong attention to layout, usability, and responsiveness.

The component combines a visual hero section, date selection functionality, and a **notes area** into a cohesive experience.



Key Features

1. Wall Calendar Aesthetic
	. Top hero image representing the current month  
	. Curved visual separation between image and content  
	. Hanging/spiral design elements to mimic a physical calendar  
	. Clean white “paper-like” layout for notes and calendar grid  

2. Day Range Selection
	. Users can select a **start date** and an **end date**  
	. Clear visual distinction for:  
	. Start date  
	. End date  
	. Dates within the selected range  
	. Selection logic handles:  
	. Reverse selection (end before start)  
	. Resetting selection on new interaction  

3. Persistent State (Local Storage)
	. Selected date range is saved per month  
	. Notes are saved per month  
	. Data persists across page reloads  
	. Each month maintains independent state  

4. Integrated Notes Section
	. Dedicated notes area styled like lined paper  
	. Users can write and edit monthly notes  
	. Notes are automatically saved using **localStorage**  

5. Fully Responsive Design
   Desktop:  
	. Two-column layout (notes + calendar)  
	. Balanced spacing and proportions  

   Mobile:  
	. Vertical stacked layout  
	. Touch-friendly date selection  
	. Readable and accessible UI  

6. Month Navigation
	. Navigate between months using **Prev / Next buttons**  
	. Month-specific:  
	. Image  
	. Notes  
	. Date range  


Tech Stack

	.React.js (Vite)
	. Zustand (State Management)  
	. Tailwind CSS (Styling)  
	. date-fns (Date utilities)  
	. localStorage (Client-side persistence)

Design Decisions

	. Zustand over Context/Redux: Lightweight global state handling without boilerplate.  
	. Month-wise persistence: Improves UX by isolating notes and selections per month.  
	. Component separation: Each UI section is modular for readability and maintainability.  
	. Minimal dependencies: Avoided heavy calendar libraries to demonstrate core logic implementation.
